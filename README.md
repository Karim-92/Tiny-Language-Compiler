# Tiny-Language-Compiler
This is a university project that I've been working on, It's a compiler for an educational language called "Tiny" which is nearly a C style language.
The compiler is built in Java, however, I plan to implement it in different languages as well.
For now, only the scanner is implemented, however, as the course progresses I'll implement the parser & the code generation features. It should be noted that this scanner is an Eclipse project and ready to import and use directly.
